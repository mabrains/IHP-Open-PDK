# PDK Models Setup
# ==============================================================
# Define the paths to measurement data and PDK model libraries
# ==============================================================

# Path to measured device model directory (raw measurement data)
mdm_dir: "../../../../libs.doc/meas/HBT/npn13g2v"

# Path to the PDK-provided model library (corner definitions)
corner_lib_path: "../../../../libs.tech/ngspice/models/cornerHBT.lib"

# ==============================================================
# Device Configuration
# ==============================================================
# Specify device type and name to clearly identify which
# transistor or component this configuration applies to
# ==============================================================

# Device category (e.g. hbt, mos, resistor, capacitor, etc.)
device_type: "hbt"

# Specific device name inside the PDK
device_name: "npn13g2v"

# ==============================================================
# Run Configuration
# ==============================================================
# Control how simulations are run and how many resources are used
# ==============================================================

# Path to the DC analysis template (Jinja2 format)
dc_template_path: "configs/hbt/hbt_dc.spice.j2"

# If true, automatically generate netlists from the template
generate_netlists: true  

# Maximum number of workers (parallel jobs).
# Set based on your system CPU cores.
max_workers: 4

# ----------------------------------------------------
# Validation Threshold Configuration
# ----------------------------------------------------
# threshold_percent_oob sets the maximum allowed percentage deviation (%) 
# between measured (silicon) and simulated (model) values.
#
# - If the deviation is <= threshold → the result is considered "within tolerance".
# - If the deviation is > threshold → the result is flagged as "out-of-bound" (OOB).
#
# Example:
#   Measured value = 1.00 mA
#   Simulated value = 1.04 mA
#   Deviation = (|1.04 - 1.00| / 1.00) × 100 = 4%
#   Since 4% < 5% → Pass (within tolerance)
#
# Another case:
#   Measured value = 1.00 mA
#   Simulated value = 1.07 mA
#   Deviation = 7%
#   Since 7% > 5% → Fail (out-of-bound)
#
# Practical Notes:
# - Use a tighter threshold (e.g., 2%) for critical devices or high-accuracy checks.
# - Use a looser threshold (e.g., 10%) when measurement data has higher noise or
#   when validating across extreme corners.
